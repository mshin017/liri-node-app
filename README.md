# liri-node-app

UCI Bootcamp Homework 8
In this assignment, I created a LIRI. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Similar to SIRI, a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, the LIRI will be a command line node app that takes parameters and gives back data. 
For this app, I am pulling data from Twitter, Spotify and OMDB.
